      **Details of investor job functions:** 

1. Capital allocation: Stock investors allocate their capital to various investment opportunities in the market. They aim to invest in stocks that have the potential to generate attractive returns, while diversifying their portfolio to mitigate risk.
2. Research and analysis: Stock investors need to perform thorough research and analysis of the companies they are interested in investing in. This includes examining financial statements, assessing industry trends, evaluating management performance, and analyzing macroeconomic factors that may impact the company's growth prospects and stock valuation.
3. Risk management: Investors need to manage the risks associated with their investments. This involves identifying potential risks, assessing their potential impact on the portfolio, and employing appropriate strategies to mitigate or hedge against these risks.
4. Portfolio management: Stock investors need to manage their portfolio effectively, ensuring that it is well-diversified and aligned with their investment goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. This may involve periodic rebalancing of the portfolio, adding or removing stocks, and adjusting asset allocation as needed.
5. Performance monitoring: Investors need to keep track of the performance of their investments, regularly reviewing and comparing them against benchmarks or target returns. This enables them to make informed decisions about adjusting their portfolio or investment strategy if necessary.
6. Staying informed: Stock investors need to stay informed about market developments, changes in economic conditions, and industry trends. This includes keeping up-to-date with financial news, analyst reports, and company announcements, as well as attending conferences, webinars, or other educational events.





### FAQ

- How to read the dataset:
    - Earnings calls are conducted by companies every quarter and every year or only ever year. In these calls, the management of the company gives a summary of the company’s performance. Investors and their representatives participate in this call and then raise questions to the management. The earnings call file will have a large string which is a transcription of the things said during these calls. Within the FMP directory of the transcripts dataset, there are several folders. Each folder represents a company and the name of the folder is the company’s symbol. Inside these directories, there would be multiple JSON files each of which represents the earnings call of a particular quarter.
    - The prices dataset is a table containing columns DATE, SYMBOL, PRICE and VOLUME. T The “symbol” identifies a particular company across the prices and transcripts datasets.
    Price represents the price of one share at the time of the last transaction of any given day.
    The volume represents the number of shares that were interacted on any given day.
- What are you expected to build:
    - Any tool that will make a financial analyst’s job easier. Their job is described as “capital allocation, research & analysis, portfolio management, staying informed & performance monitoring etc”. Your application should make some of these jobs easier.
    - You are generally expected to perform data analysis and build a web application that is able to aesthetically, functionally and reliably display the insights etc.
